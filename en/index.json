It is necessary to change the ssh setting on the client side or the server side, because ssh is automatically disconnected by a timeout if it is not operated for a while.  Remedy  Deal on the client side  Describe the following contents in /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config\nServerAliveInterval 15 ServerAliveCountMax 10 With this setting, 10 times response confirmation will send to the server every 15 seconds, and if there is still no response, it times out.\n Deal on the server side  Describe the following contents in /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nClientAliveInterval 30 ClientAliveCountMax 5 With this setting, 5 times response confirmation will send to the client every 30 seconds, and if there is still no response, it times out.\nOne more thing It is recommended to use tools such as tmux or screen, so that even if the connection is lost halfway, you can log in to the remote server again and attach the previous session.\nSSH daemon on android by termux Installation apt install openssh Setting the key ssh-keygen cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \u0026gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys chmod 700 ~/.ssh Start daemon in debug mode sshd -d Start daemon sshd Login on the PC side Set the private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa generated on the android side in the SSH client of the PC side, and connect to the server on android with specifying IP and port 8022 and without a username.\n",
