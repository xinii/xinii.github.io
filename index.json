It is recommended to use tmux to hang in the background. Test the installed OpenCV   Test the statement import cv2 through the interactive interface of python, it is good if no error is reported.  However, considering that users who use tools such as pyenv for python version management, if they switch to the python version installed under pyenv, the installed OpenCV may not be recognized. The solution is to create a soft link to the OpenCV library and link it to the python library directory under the management of pyenv.  For example, suppose the library directory of the python version in pyenv is, /home/{username}/.anyenv/envs/pyenv/versions/3.6.8/lib/python3.6/site-packages   And the installed OpenCV library path is, /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/cv2/python-3.6/cv2.cpython-36m-aarch64-linux-gnu.so   Then execute the following statement to create a soft link, cd /home/{username}/.anyenv/envs/pyenv/versions/3.6.8/lib/python3.6/site-packages ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/cv2/python-3.6/cv2.cpython-36m-aarch64-linux-gnu.so ./   Besides, use the python version of pip in pyenv to install numpy through the pip install numpy statement, and go to the interactive interface to test import cv2. If no error is displayed, the installation is complete. ",

    "description": "Gnutls errors when compiling Emacs from source? Let me take a closer look at what is going on!",
    "body": " The lack of Gnutls in the environment   If the current environment lacks Gnutls, the following configuration is required before compiling and installing the Emacs1 source code. ./configure --with-gnutls=no   Or specify the installation directory at the same time, add the option to ignore other dependent libraries that are still missing, such as the following configuration. bash configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-gif=no --with-gnutls=no   In this way, the configuration and installation can be carried out smoothly in the absence of permission to the default installation path, or the lack of various dependent libraries. Potential problems   Although the above can achieve the purpose of normal installation of Emacs to the $HOME/.local directory, However, due to the lack of the Gnutls component, when using network transmission in Emacs, you can only use http instead of https.  If only needs a network connection during Emacs initialization, you can solve the problem by changing the Melpa links to start with http, but this will cause problems for future extensions that require network connectivity in Emacs.  For example, when using google-translate, even if the https in all *.el files in the google-translate package are changed to http, during actual use, some https services will still be used automatically, resulting in abnormal translation.  One thing to note here is that after modifying the *.el file, you need to delete all *.elc files to force a recompilation to make the changes take effect. Install Gnutls   After the above actual tests, it is not difficult to find that it is a good choice to install Emacs from the source code after installing Gnutls in the current environment.  Taking OpenSUSE as an example, Gnutls can be installed by running the following statement on the terminal. sudo zypper install gnutls  Other possible problems  checking for library containing tputs... no configure: error: The required function \u0026#39;tputs\u0026#39; was not found in any library.

For example, a libncurses-dev(el) or similar package. make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop. make: *** No rule to make target \u0026#39;install\u0026#39;. Stop.   Besides, if Gnutls is installed in the current environment, and the above error is still reported after make, then for OpenSUSE environment, you need a package called ncurses-devel, execute the following sentence to install. sudo zypper install ncurses-devel  1  The logo of Emacs     ",

    "body": " From bash to zsh   Although I switched to the fish shell two weeks after using the zsh shell (the fish shell has a special introduction below), this does not deny that the zsh shell is still a good shell. You can switch from any shell to zsh shell in the following way.    Use the following instructions when installing zsh,   brew install zsh (MacOS) apt install zsh (Ubuntu / Linux Mint)     If you want to know the shell currently installed in the system, enter the following command,   cat /etc/shells     How to use zsh as your default shell? Enter the following command,   chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh     Error reading about the configuration file    When the shell script explains the error, you can check the currently used sh path. For example, it may be that sh points to dash, which causes an error. View through the following statement. ls -l `which sh`     Script interpreter differences in syntax    When switching from traditional bash and other shells to zsh, you will find that the index of the first element of the collection starts from 1. If you want to start from 0, configure the following statement in the configuration file.    Fix array index for zsh:   if [ \u0026#34;$ZSH_NAME\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;zsh\u0026#34; ];then setopt localoptions ksharrays fi  Configure zsh   Similar to the bash shell\u0026#39;s .bashrc, the configuration of zsh also requires a configuration file. This file is the .zshrc file in the user directory. Click here to open the configuration file I uploaded to Github to download and use. From zsh to fish-shell   After using the zsh shell, I switched to the fish shell in about two weeks. This is not because zsh is not good, but the natural completion and ease of use of fish attracted me. After moving to the fish environment, the shell toss is a conclusion. The following records of the process. fish shell installation and default shell switch   This was mentioned above. Now we will introduce the instructions that different operating systems need to execute.    MacOS:   brew install fish     Ubuntu/Linux Mint:   apt install fish     OpenSUSE:   sudo zypper install fish   If it is an OpenSUSE environment running under Windows, you may need root permission, then add sudo in front of the command. Use the following statement to view the shell used by the current system. cat /etc/shells   If your fish shell is displayed at /usr/bin/fish, Then execute the following statement to switch it to the default shell (add sudo if you have insufficient permissions). chsh -s /usr/bin/fish   Now reopen a terminal session and you will find that the default shell has been switched to fish. If it reports a lot of errors about hostname immediately after opening the fish shell, that is to say, the current environment lacks a package called hostname, then use the package manager of the distribution you are using to install hostname, for example, under OpenSUSE, sudo zypper install hostname  Configuration of Fish shell   The configuration I wrote was uploaded on Github, click here to view my configuration. Common problems when using python under the fish shell   There are two issues that I need to pay attention to at present,    About tmux    When tmux has a session in the background, even if the update PYTHONPATH environment variable will not take effect, then all processes of tmux need to be closed before the update will take effect. In addition to fish, other shell environments should also be encountered. I first appeared in fish and kept it as a record.    About PYTHONPATH    The way to define environment variables in fish shell is set \u0026lt;variable_name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;parameter_1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;parameter_2\u0026gt; This method has great advantages and is very convenient, but for PYTHONPATH, then set PYTHONPATH \u0026lt;parameter_1\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;parameter_2\u0026gt; is more versatile. The reason is that after testing, both methods can be used normally under MacOS, but it is running on Jetson When testing under Ubuntu on Nano, only the second method is available. The specific reason is not yet clear, there may be different reasons for the operating system, It may also be caused by different python versions (For example, the version number is the same, but the different processor architectures cause differences in compilation methods and cause this problem).

    "body": " Install Jekyll   Jekyll1 is a static website generation framework written in Ruby language. The following is the official website introduction.   Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more. –Jekyll2   When installing Jekyll, you first need a Ruby package management environment. The commonly used package manager of the Ruby programming environment is gem. For example, executing the following statement in Ubuntu will also install gem. apt install ruby-dev   After installing gem, make sure its execution path is in our PATH environment variable. If you do not use the above method, but use virtual environment management tools such as rbenv, just call the gem configured in the virtual environment. Then you can install Jekyll by executing the following statement. gem install jekyll  Publish blog to Github   After installing Jekyll, you must hope to post something to Github first to see the effect. Especially understand this mood.  Then next, before blogging, let\u0026#39;s firstly use Jekyll installed to generate a default site and publish it to Github. Execute the following command in the current path where you want to manage the blog locally. jekyll new folder-name-for-your-blog   Then a folder called folder-name-for-your-blog will be generated under the current path, which is the new blog source code created by Jekyll.  Then create a repository called your-user-name-of-github.github.io on Github. After creating the repository, Github will prompt how to use git to push local content to the repository. Follow the wizard to push the contents of the folder-name-for-your-blog folder you just created to this repository.  Then wait a few minutes to open your-user-name-of-github.github.io through your browser, and you can see Jekyll\u0026#39;s welcome page if nothing unexpected happens.  This site is also created by the above method.
