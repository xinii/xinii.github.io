Let us look at the definition on Wikipedia.\n A scancode (or scan code) is the data that most computer keyboards send to a computer to report which keys have been pressed. A number, or sequence of numbers, is assigned to each key on the keyboard. \u0026ndash;Wikipedia1 Example of keyboard scan code 2    Key Code     RCtrl 1D E0   LAlt 38 00   RAlt 38 E0   ESC 01 00   Insert 52 E0   Enter 1C 00   Caps 3A 00   Space 39 00   Muhenkan key 7B 00   Henkan key 79 00    Perform keyboard scan code mapping in the registry   First, press the Windows logo key + R, enter regedit and then press Enter to open the Windows Registry Editor. Then open the following location in the registry editor.\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Keyboard Layout   Next, right-click on the blank space and create a binary key called \u0026ldquo;Scancode Map\u0026rdquo; in the order of \u0026ldquo;New-Binary Value (B)-Scancode Map\u0026rdquo;. Double-click to edit.\nRegarding the value of \u0026ldquo;Scancode Map\u0026rdquo; (that is, the mapping rule), taking my settings as an example, the following table is listed for reference. Here, the parts of \u0026ldquo;version\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;flag\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;terminal null value\u0026rdquo; should be left as they are. In addition, regarding the \u0026ldquo;number of mappings\u0026rdquo;, it is necessary to set the sum of the number of mapping rules and the number of \u0026ldquo;terminal null values\u0026rdquo;.\n  The mapping of my Logicool K380 keyboard (Japanese layout)\n   Index Scancode Mapping Scancode Mapping     0000 00 00 00 00 Version 00 00 00 00 Flag   0008 08 00 00 00 Number of mappings 1D 00 3A 00 LCtrl \u0026lt;- Caps   0010 3A 00 1D 00 Caps \u0026lt;- LCtrl 1D E0 38 00 RCtrl \u0026lt;- LAlt   0018 38 00 7B 00 LAlt \u0026lt;- Muhenkan 38 E0 70 00 RAlt \u0026lt;- Kana   0020 39 00 79 00 Space \u0026lt;- Henkan 01 00 38 E0 ESC \u0026lt;- RAlt   0028 00 00 00 00 Terminal null value        The mapping of my FILCO Majestouch MINILA Air keyboard (Japanese layout)\n   Index Scancode Mapping Scancode Mapping     0000 00 00 00 00 Version 00 00 00 00 Flag   0008 0B 00 00 00 Number of mappings 1C 00 52 E0 Enter \u0026lt;- Insert   0010 1D E0 38 00 RCtrl \u0026lt;- LAlt 1D E0 70 00 RCtrl \u0026lt;- Kana   0018 7B 00 46 00 Muhenkan \u0026lt;- ScrollLock 79 00 1D E1 Henkan \u0026lt;- Pause   0020 00 00 45 00 Null \u0026lt;- NumLock 00 00 9D E1 Null \u0026lt;- Break   0028 38 00 7B 00 LAlt \u0026lt;- Muhenkan 01 00 79 00 ESC \u0026lt;- Henkan   0030 52 E0 29 00 Insert \u0026lt;- E/J 00 00 00 00 Terminal null value      It should be noted here that the \u0026ldquo;Pause/Break\u0026rdquo; key is not composed of a single scan code, The scan code of \u0026ldquo;NumLock\u0026rdquo; is also included, and it needs to be flexibly set according to the situation.

The following is the official website introduction.\n Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more. \u0026ndash;Jekyll2 When installing Jekyll, you first need a Ruby package management environment. The commonly used package manager of the Ruby programming environment is gem. For example, executing the following statement in Ubuntu will also install gem.\napt install ruby-dev After installing gem, make sure its execution path is in our PATH environment variable. If you do not use the above method, but use virtual environment management tools such as rbenv, just call the gem configured in the virtual environment. Then you can install Jekyll by executing the following statement.\ngem install jekyll Publish blog to Github After installing Jekyll, you must hope to post something to Github first to see the effect. Especially understand this mood.\nThen next, before blogging, let\u0026rsquo;s firstly use Jekyll installed to generate a default site and publish it to Github. Execute the following command in the current path where you want to manage the blog locally.\njekyll new folder-name-for-your-blog Then a folder called folder-name-for-your-blog will be generated under the current path, which is the new blog source code created by Jekyll.\nThen create a repository called your-user-name-of-github.github.io on Github. After creating the repository, Github will prompt how to use git to push local content to the repository. Follow the wizard to push the contents of the folder-name-for-your-blog folder you just created to this repository.\nThen wait a few minutes to open your-user-name-of-github.github.io through your browser, and you can see Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s welcome page if nothing unexpected happens.\n~~This site is also created by the above method. ~~\n(Postscript on June 14, 2020)\n[This site] (https://xinii.github.io) has now been created using the hugo static website generation framework, To refer to the original site, please [click here] (https://xinii.github.io/jekyll-blog) to visit.\nWelcome to contact and leave a message.\n  The logo of Jekyll \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n jekyllrb.com \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ",
